Title: An R Package Providing an Blueprints and Tools for Functional Models for Regression
Version: 0.8.0
Author: Dr. Thomas Weise <tweise@hfuu.edu.cn>
Maintainer: Dr. Thomas Weise <tweise@hfuu.edu.cn>
Description: In this package, we provide blueprints and tools for defining functional models
    for regression. First, there is a base class called \code{FunctionalModel} which
    allows specifying a model function with parameters, boundaries for the model parameters,
    a gradient function and a parameter guesser. Second, there are some utility methods that
    can be used to validate and guess parameters of such a model. Third, we provide a set of
    basic model instances of the model blueprints that can be used. This set will be
    continuously extented in the future.
